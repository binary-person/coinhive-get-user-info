# Coinhive User Info
## This time with Hashes Per Second!
### Another Proud Project by Simon Cheng

I created this app because there were no hashes per second specificly for each user by default on the CoinHive Dashboard \*tear\*
But wait, here comes this app!

To simply install, just run these commands, be sure you have node and npm installed
```
git clone https://github.com/scheng123/coinhive-get-user-info
cd coinhive-get-user-info/
npm install
```
To run, either `npm start` or `node index.js`

Enjoy!
